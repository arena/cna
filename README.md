# CNA Skills Practice App

A free app for students studying to become nursing assistants to practice for the Nevada State Nursing Board CNA skills test administered by Credentia.

## What This App Does

The CNA Skills Practice App provides:

- **5 Skills Selection**: Generates a semi-random set of 5 skills following Nevada test rules
- **Hand Washing**: always the first skill of the 5 skills.
- **A Measurement Skill**: always the second skill of the 5 (pulse, respirations, bp, weight, or urinary output).
- **Three Additional Random Skills**: will always include at least one skill involving water. 
- **30-minute Timer**: Simulates the actual exam time limit of the skills test.
- **Step-by-step Breakdown**: Shows all steps for each skill with critical steps bolded and highlighted.
- **Progress Tracking**: Lets you mark each step as completed, skipped, or incorrect (optionally).
- **Results Summary**: Shows completion times and performance for each skill if steps were marked.

## Available Skills

The app includes all 22 skills from the Nevada CNA test bank, properly categorized as:
- **Water Skills**: Bathing, oral care, grooming, etc.
- **Measurement Skills**: Vital signs, weight, height
- **Personal Care**: Positioning, transfers, feeding
