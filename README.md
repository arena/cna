# CNA Friend

A free CNA Skills Practice App for students studying to become nursing assistants to practice for the Nevada State Nursing Board CNA skills test administered by Credentia.

## What This App Does

CNA Friend provides:

- **Practice Test with 5 Skills**: generates a semi-random set of 5 skills or lets you hand pick. 
- **Hand Washing**: always the first skill of the 5 skills.
- **A Measurement Skill**: always the second skill of the 5 (pulse, respirations, bp, weight, or urinary output).
- **Three Additional Random Skills**: random sets will always include at least one skill involving water. 
- **30-minute Timer**: simulates the actual exam time limit of the skills test.
- **Step-by-step Breakdown**: shows all steps for each skill with critical steps bolded and highlighted.
- **Progress Tracking**: lets you mark each step as completed, skipped, or incorrect (optionally).
- **Results Summary**: shows completion times and performance for each skill if steps were marked.
- **Skills List**: The app also has additional views for studying individual skills and lets users sort them by number, type, or length of time.
- **Voice Evaluator**: Listens and evaluates as you verbalize the steps of a skill (!)

## Available Skills

The app includes the 22 skills from the Nevada CNA test bank listed in the Credentia Nevada published skills list. Issues with verb tense or awkward wording are left in for accuracy. Supplies and tips were added for your convenience but are not part of the official skills. Human or AI error may have occured in the transcription of the skills.
For reference, the skills are listed at https://credentia.com/test-takers/nv/, and specifically, at https://kb-nv.credentia.com/en/article/skills.

## Disclaimer

This app is for study purposes only. Students should always defer to the official skills checklist and requirements published by their state nursing board and testing organization (such as Credentia). The content here is meant to supplement your studies, not replace official materials.
