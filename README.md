# CNA Skills Practice App

A free app for students studying to become nursing assistants to practice for the Nevada State Nursing Board CNA skills test administered by Credentia.

## What This App Does

The CNA Skills Practice App provides:

- **5 Skills Selection**: Generates a semi-random set of 5 skills following Nevada test rules
- **Hand Washing**: always the first skill of the 5 skills.
- **A Measurement Skill**: always the second skill of the 5 (pulse, respirations, bp, weight, or urinary output).
- **Three Additional Random Skills**: will always include at least one skill involving water. 
- **30-minute Timer**: Simulates the actual exam time limit of the skills test.
- **Step-by-step Breakdown**: Shows all steps for each skill with critical steps bolded and highlighted.
- **Progress Tracking**: Lets you mark each step as completed, skipped, or incorrect (optionally).
- **Results Summary**: Shows completion times and performance for each skill if steps were marked.

- **Skills List**: The app also has additional views for studying individual skills and lets users sort them by number, type, or length (time)

- **Experimental AI Eval**: Listens and evaluates as you verbalize the steps of a skill (!)

- **Do you have ideas for features?**: Please contribute or create an issue in github to suggest what you would like to see. 

## Available Skills

The app includes all 22 skills from the Nevada CNA test bank. Derived from the Credentia Nevada published skills list as directly as possible. Issues with verb tense or awkward wording are left in for accuracy.
