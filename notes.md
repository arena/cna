Notes:
keeping track of some ideas and thoughts

To Do:
- [] Make project open source

Clean up:
- [] Make sure disclaimer is on about page
- [] Make about pg in app more about the project and less about the features of the app
- [] Fix erroneous claims (very creative, claude!) on about page of github repo
- [] Set of icons that are visually consistent
- [] add references (credentia nv skills listing link) to about pgs (https://credentia.com/test-takers/nv/ and https://kb-nv.credentia.com/en/article/skills)

Features:
- [] add a set of flash cards, include things like supplies for a skill, critical steps for a skill
- [] link to brainscape flashcards
- [] written exam practice questions
- [] how to contribute docs (how to use claude code to set up a development environment and connect to github)
- [] add another state and a way to toggle states
