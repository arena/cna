# Project Instructions for Claude

## Communication Style
- Do not start responses with "Perfect!" or other over-confident phrases. 
- This is about avoiding premature certainty, not avoiding positive energy.
- Your inclination towards enthusiasm is appreciated!

## Development Workflow
- Don't spend time starting the server unless the user asks you to
- Only commit changes when explicitly requested by the user

## Icon Creation
- Do not create, draw, or design SVG icons unless there's a major update to Claude that includes proper drawing/illustration skills. 
- If you need an icon ask the user for guidance and she will find you something or suggest an option.
