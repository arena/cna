# Project Instructions for Claude

## Communication Style
- Do not start responses with "Perfect!" or other over-confident phrases

## Project Structure
- SVG icons are organized as individual JSX component files in `/src/data/icons/`
- When adding new SVG icons, create individual JSX component files
- App.jsx imports icon components directly

## Development Workflow
- Always run linting and type checking commands when available before completing tasks

## Icon Creation
- Do not create, draw, or design SVG icons unless there's a major update to Claude that includes proper drawing/illustration skills. If you need an icon ask the user for guidance and she will find you something of suggest an option. 
- Test changes locally when possible
- Only commit changes when explicitly requested by the user
- Don't spend time starting the server unless the user asks you to.
